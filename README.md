# Puerto model
#### author: Juan Busqué (CIFA - Centro de Investigación y Formación Agrarias research centre)

The Puerto model [1] was created in response to some of nowadays agricultural systems challenges, combining well–established knowledge and algorithms from international scientific research [2-9]. The Puerto model was developed at the Centre for Agricultural Research and Training of Cantabria (CIFA) by Dr. Juan Busqué as part of its research on the structure, growth and utilization of pastures in the Cantabrian rangeland. Puerto is an empirical dynamic model based on established biophysical relationships and constants between vegetation’s life cycle (including growth, senescence, vegetation death and litterfall), livestock grazing process (livestock ingestion, digestion, excretion and weight change) and the nitrogen cycle (nitrogen uptake, soil cycling and leaching). It evaluates existing nitrogen and grazing imbalances (under- or overgrazing) and their relationship with animal productivity. Puerto’s four main goals are to: (i) provide a tool to support pastoral management; (ii) quantify and assess grazing system and nitrogen cycle imbalances; (iii) enable managers to develop strategies to resolve imbalances; and (iv) visualize the effects of management actions through scenarios. This model has proven to be a valuable tool for modelling pastureland in Cantabria and was used in several regional projects at different temporal and spatial scales [10-12]. Moreover, its reliability and usefulness have been validated and improved over the years.
